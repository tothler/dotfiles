# dotfiles

I use Arch, if you don't, your packages might be different blah blah blah.

Packages:

	* xmonad
	* xmonad-contrib
	* xmobar
	* compton
	* rxvt-unicode
	* feh
	* tamsyn-font
	* gohufont
        * font-awesome
        * gvim

The `spotify\_scripts` obviously don't work without spotify. They are 
helper scripts so `xmobar` can display the current song spotify is playing.
`.xmobarrc` may need to be edited, it assumes the scripts are in your `$PATH`.

`.xinitrc` sets the background with `feh`. The actual image file it uses
probably should be changed.
